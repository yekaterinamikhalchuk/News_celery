Actions like these that benefit others are known in psychology as prosocial behaviours.
 In a COVID context, prosocial behaviours reduce the spread of the virus and keep health-care institutions functioning. 
What does sport have to do with civic values? 
Adolescence is an important time for developing civic values. Personal life experiences, relationships and social contexts all influence this development. These contexts can include home, school and extracurricular activities such as sport. Sport requires us to work with others to achieve team goals. In this way, it can help children to develop attributes such as altruism and empathy. 
Unfortunately, in elite sports, gamesmanship, greed, cheating and a win-at-any-cost mentality can sometimes be elevated above positive virtues such as courage, co-operation and sportsmanship. In our study, many student teachers referred to news reports with negative messages about cheating, doping and racism. Sport has recently been a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Events have been cancelled and games played in empty stadiums. But sport has also been a shining light for people struggling in lockdown. This was particularly true of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) described the event as a beacon of hope after so much of normal life was brought to a standstill. Other commentators have similarly said Tokyo made sport a shining light in the gloom and described the Games as such a welcomed distraction, really highlighted how much sport can bring a smile to people’s faces. 
So, how do we maximise the benefits? Teaching students about civic values and sport as part of the school curriculum isn’t the only way to foster prosocial behaviour. We can reap its broader benefits for a healthier society by encouraging young people to play sport at school and in the community.</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">1</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel" to="news.author">4</field></object><object model="news.post" pk="22"><field name="news_type" type="CharField">N</field><field name="creation_date" type="DateTimeField">2022-04-02T13:33:17.451773+00:00</field><field name="post_title" type="CharField">Amazon of Europe is first UNESCO biosphere to cover five nations</field><field name="post_text" type="TextField">UNESCO has designated the worlds first biosphere to span across five different countries - and theyre all in Europe..
The new biosphere reserve covers an area of 700km and includes parts of Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. The basis of the biosphere is a route along the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers that wind through these five European nations. Dubbed the Amazon of Europe, the biosphere is precedent-setting as a multinational effort to curb ecological destruction. It is the largest river-based protected area in the entirety of Europe.
What is a biosphere and why is it important? 
Biospheres are crucial for ecological restoration as their UNESCO protected status ensures an areas biodiversity and ecological structures, like floodplains, are protected from outside destructive interests.The Mura, Drava and Danube biosphere will protect floodplains, forests, sand and gravel banks, steep banks, and backwaters. It will also look after a huge number of animal species, including the highest density of breeding white-tailed eagles in continental Europe.
Why was this biosphere created?
The five countries involved in the biosphere have worked for a long time to receive the UNESCO designation. The process began in 2009 when the governments of Croatia and Hungary signed a joint declaration committing to the protection of a cross-border biosphere reserve. All five countries environmental ministers then made a joint declaration in favour of the reserve in 2011. Following this, each of the countrys parts of the rivers involved received biosphere reserve status. 
First Croatia and Hungary in 2012, with Serbia, Slovenia, and Austria joining in 2017, 2018, and 2019 respectively. Are there more biospheres in the EU and beyond? This biosphere is a success of EU coordination and will go some way to reversing the damage to floodplains in the region. The biosphere will contribute to the EUs Green New Deal. This is the commissions proposed method of transforming the EUs economy to get to no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. It also promises to move away from creating economic growth through the use of non-sustainable resources. Outside of the EU, there are many other biospheres that could benefit from a similar UNESCO status. 
UNESCO has a database of biosphere reserves. Included are 714 biosphere reserves in 129 countries, including 21 transboundary sites. Other transboundary biospheres include the Vosges du Nord/Pfälzerwald region across France and Germany. Originally receiving its designation in 1998, the area shares water, sandstone and forests.</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">1</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel" to="news.author">5</field></object><object model="news.post" pk="23"><field name="news_type" type="CharField">N</field><field name="creation_date" type="DateTimeField">2022-04-02T13:33:17.453843+00:00</field><field name="post_title" type="CharField">Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022: England could face Scotland or Wales in group stage</field><field name="post_text" type="TextField">England could face Scotland or Wales at the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 after the draw for the tournament's finals was made on Friday.

The price rises are putting increasing pressure on household budgets. 
Which prices are going up? 
From 1 April, fuel bills for about 18 million households on standard tariffs will go up by an average of £693 when the energy cap goes up.Some 4.5 million prepayment customers will see an average increase of £708. Fuel prices may go up again in October when the energy cap is next reviewed.The rate of VAT - the tax paid when buying goods and services - is also going up for some businesses.The government reduced the rate paid by hospitality and tourism firms to 12.5% in July 2020, to help them recover from the pandemic.However, from 1 April, VAT returns to the standard rate of 20%. Some companies have said they will pass this increase on to customers.On 6 April, companies, workers and the self-employed will start paying 1.25p more in the pound in National Insurance contributions under the Health and Social Care Levy.Air passenger duty and vehicle excise duty rates are also increasing this month, as is the cost of stamps, and water bills in England and Wales.
Food prices have also gone up sharply. Petrol prices have risen to record levels.
Higher interest rates are making mortgage payments more expensive for some homeowners.
Regulated rail fares in England have already gone up by up to 3.8% in England and Wales, the highest fare rises for nine years.
Why are prices rising now?
The main reason is the rising global price of energy which is affecting companies across the whole economy.Wholesale gas prices in particular have risen sharply over the past year, forcing energy prices up, and putting a number of suppliers out of business.The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which publishes economic forecasts twice a year, has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have 'major repercussions for the global economy', and push energy, petrol and food costs even higher.</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">2</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel" to="news.author">6</field></object><object model="news.post" pk="25"><field name="news_type" type="CharField">A</field><field name="creation_date" type="DateTimeField">2022-04-02T13:33:17.457518+00:00</field><field name="post_title" type="CharField">Liberia taxi driver: How returning $50,000 changed Emmanuel Tuloe's life</field><field name="post_text" type="TextField">The story of what happened to Liberian Emmanuel Tuloe has the quality of a modern fable.The 19-year-old, dressed in a school uniform of sky blue shirt and navy shorts, looks incongruous in a class full of pupils at least six years younger than him.But the one-time primary school dropout is happy.Last year, he was struggling to earn a living as a motorbike taxi driver when he found $50,000 (£40,000) in a mix of US and Liberian notes, wrapped in a plastic bag by the side of the road. 
He could have easily pocketed this life-changing amount. But he gave it to his aunt to look after and when the rightful owner appealed on national radio for help in finding the cash, Emmanuel came forward. 
Mocked by some for his honesty - people laughed at him saying he would die poor - his act earned him generous rewards including a place at Ricks Institute, one of Liberia's most prestigious schools. 
President George Weah handed him $10,000 and a local media owner also gave him cash, some of which was raised from viewers and listeners. And the owner of the money that was found donated $1,500-worth of goods. 
On top of those and perhaps most significantly, a college in the US reacted by offering him a full scholarship once he had completed his secondary education.</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">1</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel" to="news.author">6</field></object><object model="news.post" pk="26"><field name="news_type" type="CharField">A</field><field name="creation_date" type="DateTimeField">2022-04-02T13:33:17.460948+00:00</field><field name="post_title" type="CharField">Climate change: Wind and solar reach milestone as demand surges</field><field name="post_text" type="TextField">Wind and solar generated 10% of global electricity for the first time in 2021, a new analysis shows.Fifty countries get more than a tenth of their power from wind and solar sources, according to research from Ember, a climate and energy think tank.As the world's economies rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, demand for energy soared.Demand for electricity grew at a record pace. This saw a surge in coal power, rising at the fastest rate since 1985. 
Heatwaves redefined in England over climate change

Pressure grows for global deal to save nature 
The research shows the growth in the need for electricity last year was the equivalent of adding a new India to the world's grid.Solar and wind and other clean sources generated 38% of the world's electricity in 2021. For the first time wind turbines and solar panels generated 10% of the total. 
The share coming from wind and sun has doubled since 2015, when the Paris climate agreement was signed. 
The fastest switching to wind and solar took place in the Netherlands, Australia, and Vietnam. All three have moved a tenth of their electricity demand from fossil fuels to green sources in the last two years. 
The Netherlands is a great example of a more northern latitude country proving that it's not just where the Sun shines, it's also about having the right policy environment that makes the big difference in whether solar takes off, said Hannah Broadbent from Ember. 
Vietnam also saw spectacular growth, particularly in solar which rose by over 300% in just one year.
In the case of Vietnam, there was a massive step up in solar generation and it was driven by feed-in tariffs - money the government pays you for generating electricity - which made it very attractive for households and for utilities to be deploying large amounts of solar, said Dave Jones, Ember's global lead. 
What we saw with that was a massive step up in solar generation last year, which didn't just meet increased electricity demand, but it also led to a fall in both coal and gas generation. 
Despite the growth and the fact that some countries like Denmark now get more than 50% of their electricity from wind and solar, coal power also saw a remarkable rise in 2021.</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">-1</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel" to="news.author">7</field></object><object model="news.post" pk="27"><field name="news_type" type="CharField">N</field><field name="creation_date" type="DateTimeField">2022-04-02T13:33:17.463169+00:00</field><field name="post_title" type="CharField">Sri Lanka imposes curfew amid food, fuel and power shortage protests</field><field name="post_text" type="TextField">A 36-hour curfew has been announced in Sri Lanka as a state of emergency is enforced amid violent protests against food and fuel shortages.The move is aimed at stopping new protests - two days after crowds set vehicles ablaze near President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's private residence.

This could add another £629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented £700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight.
The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay.Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers.
The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to £2,600 from October.
A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.
Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating.We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households, he told the BBC.
He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted.
The warning comes on top of a huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year.
At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax going up for some on 1 April.
Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow.

Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Thursday stating buyers must pay in roubles through Russian bank accounts from Friday.
The Kremlin said this would not affect shipments which were already paid for, with payments for deliveries after 1 April due in mid-April at the earliest.
The country is seeking to shore up the rouble as Western sanctions bite.
Does this mean that if there is no confirmation in roubles, then gas supplies will be cut off from 1 April? No, it doesn't, and it doesn't follow from the decree,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.
The EU said it was talking to energy companies about how to pay for gas. 
Ditte Juul Jorgensen, the director general of the European Commission energy directorate, tweeted that the EU was 'working closely with member states and operators... to establish a common approach on currency payments for gas contracts with Russia'.Since Russia invaded Ukraine Western nations have placed sanctions on Russian companies and individuals.
Unlike the US and Canada, the EU has not placed bans on oil or gas, as its member nations are heavily reliant on it.
Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles 
Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing
Russia supplies the European Union (EU) with about 40% of its gas and a third of its oil imports which are mainly paid for in euros and dollars.
The EU has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted, but at the same time, Russia is making €400m (£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has very few options for rerouting this supply to other markets. 
Member states in the EU have been on alert for any disruption to Russian gas imports as tension continues between Russia and the West over the Ukraine invasion.
On Wednesday, Germany and Austria took the first steps towards gas rationing. Germany urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages, while Austria said it was tightening its monitoring of the gas market.
A crunch point appeared to be in the offing when Moscow issued a decree on Thursday requiring foreign buyers of Russian gas to open rouble accounts from Friday or else risk being cut-off.
Moscow did, however, offer a mechanism for buyers to obtain roubles via the state-run Gazprombank.
The bank has escaped sanctions from the EU to allow energy trading to continue.
The UK has imposed sanctions on Gazprombank, but imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia.
UK and Dutch wholesale gas prices fell on Friday after the announcement that Russian gas supplies would not be halted immediately.
Westbound flows of Russian gas via major routes were steady on Friday.

Employers added 428,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 391,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. It marked the 12th consecutive month that job gains topped 400,000. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.

HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE MISSED THE MARK ON SURGING INFLATION

Job gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in the pandemic-battered leisure and hospitality industry (78,000), manufacturing (55,000), and transportation and warehousing (52,000).

The labor force participation rate, a key measure of the active workforce, fell 0.2 percentage points in April to 62.2%, matching the lowest level recorded this year as the labor force shrank by 363,000 workers.

"The job market continues to plow forward, buoyed by strong employer demand. After just over two years of the pandemic, the job market is remaining resilient and on track for a return to pre-pandemic levels this summer," said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at jobs review site Glassdoor. "However, the job market is showing some signs of cooling as it turns the corner and the recovery enters a new phase."

Businesses are eager to onboard new employees and are raising wages in order to attract workers as they confront a labor shortage. There were roughly 11.5 million open jobs at the end of March – the highest on record – while the number of Americans quitting their job has also climbed to a new high.

Millions of workers are seeing the largest pay gains in years, as companies compete with one another for a limited number of employees. Earnings rose 5.5% in April from the previous year, nearly double the pre-pandemic average of 3%. There are signs that growth could be moderating, with earnings climbing just 0.3% on a monthly basis, slower than Refinitiv expected.

Many of those gains have been eroded, however, by the hottest inflation in nearly four decades, which has pushed the price of everyday necessities like gasoline, clothing and food significantly higher. 

The rising prices have been bad news for President Biden, who has seen his approval rating plunge as inflation climbs higher. 

Inflation has also forced the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively. Central bank policymakers raised interest rates by 25 basis points in March and 50 basis points in May, and have signaled that more mega-sized hikes are on the table at coming meetings. Although there are growing fears that the Fed could inadvertently drag the economy into a recession with its tightening, Chairman Jerome Powell has argued the labor market and consumer demand are strong enough to prevent a downturn.

Friday's data may bolster that argument and likely solidifies the central bank's charted rate hike course, according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.

"Investors need confidence that the Fed won’t raise too aggressively and topple the economy into recession in their fight against inflation," Lynch said. "Today’s report is balanced and may prove to dampen the extreme volatility of recent days. We’re still not out of the woods, yet a clearing is visible."</field><field name="post_rating" type="IntegerField">0</field><field name="author" rel="ManyToOneRel"
